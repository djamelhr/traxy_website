                                    <h4>Route Optimization for field service fleets: What you need to know</h4>
                                    <p>Running a tight ship in field services demands that you’ve got your logistics optimized. Failure to do so can add up to wasted fuel, dissatisfied customers and a big drop in performance. That said, what can field services managers do to optimize their driver routes and take their approach to the next level?</p>
                                    <p>It all starts with clear communication and timely notifications for your drivers. Without a clean line of communication back and forth, there’s a lot of room for error. In small fleets, it may be easy to handle a lot of this manually, but it’s ultimately a poor use of resources. As your business grows, the amount of time it takes to manage and optimize a growing number of fleet vehicles and drivers becomes cost prohibitive—fast.</p>
                                    <p>Let’s have a look at some of the key drivers of route optimization for field services fleets.</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>What Are the Logistics Behind On-Time Deliveries?</h5>
                                    <p>Everybody wants to give their customers an exact ETA and stick to it. Unfortunately, this is the real world and, well, there’s a reason we need software to weave together driver communication, customer agendas and the GPS tracking that works like glue to hold it all together.</p>

                                    <p>Having a clear picture of where drivers are on the daily agenda alongside real-time traffic data is crucial when it comes to on-time delivery. And when roadblocks arise, you’re able to update your customers easily.</p>

                                    <h5>How Can I Optimize Operations with Route Planning Software?</h5>
                                    <p>There are a few key ways you can optimize your routes with route planning software. Here are just a few things you could easily achieve:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Optimize to serve more customers per day and generate more revenue</li>
                                        <li>Cut distances and idle time wherever possible to save on fuel costs</li>
                                        <li>Avoid traffic and trouble spots on the grid to keep your fleet running smoothly and efficiently</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>There are other opportunities to optimize operations with this kind of software as well through direct communication with your drivers. The hardware that drives the software’s capability can also help you monitor vehicle health and performance so that you can pull your fleet vehicles for maintenance without costly unplanned downtime.</p>

                                    <h5>How Can I Reduce Fleet Fuel Costs?</h5>
                                    <p>Having more effective routes is a simple fuel savings outcome. But, as we mentioned there are other ways that route optimization solutions can help you save on fuel costs:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Monitoring error codes that affect performance like a fouled spark plug or plugged/restricted fuel injector which can reduce fuel efficiency as much as 30 percent.</li>
                                        <li>Shortening or eliminating idle times by avoiding traffic and other barriers.</li>
                                        <li>Increasing the number of stops within a given radius so that you’re serving more customers in less time.</li>
                                    </ul>
